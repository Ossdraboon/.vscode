What is HTML?:
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.


Simple Html Document structure:
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
The <h1> element defines a large heading
The <p> element defines a paragraph


What is an HTML Element?:
What is an Tag?:
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag
<tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag
<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!


Web Browsers:
The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them correctly.
A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document.


HTML Documents:
All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration <!DOCTYPE html>.
The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.
The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>.


The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration:
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.
It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is


HTML Headings:
HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading
Example
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is heading 3</h3>


HTML Paragraphs:
HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag
Example
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>


HTML Links:
HTML links are defined with the <a> tag
Example
<a href="https://ccwiki.digitalcampusvorarlberg.at/index.php/Hauptseite">This is a link</a>
The link's destination is specified in the href attribute. 
Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.


HTML Images:
HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.
The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes
Example
<img src="test.jpg" alt="test.com" width="104" height="142">

There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute
1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src="https://dcv.at/images/guyla.jpg".

Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.

2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="gyula.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/gyula.jpg".

Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.



View HTML Source Code:
Click CTRL + U in an HTML page, or right-click on the page and select "View Page Source". This will open a new tab containing the HTML source code of the page.

Inspect an HTML Element:
Right-click on an element (or a blank area), and choose "Inspect" to see what elements are made up of (you will see both the HTML and the CSS). You can also edit the HTML or CSS on-the-fly in the Elements or Styles panel that opens.

1.1
HTML Elements:
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag
<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>

Examples of some HTML elements
<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
<h1-h6> content </h1-h6>
<p> content </p>
<br> 

1.2
HTML Attributes:
All HTML elements can have attributes
The href attribute of <a> specifies the URL of the page the link goes to
The src attribute of <img> specifies the path to the image to be displayed
The width and height attributes of <img> provide size information for images
The alt attribute of <img> provides an alternate text for an image
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more
The lang attribute of the <html> tag declares the language of the Web page
The title attribute defines some extra information about an element


Attributes provide additional information about elements
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like name="value"
The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to
The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed
The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.
You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.
The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.
The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element


Examples: of a Tag with Attributes
<a href="URL"  > content </a>
<img src="gyula.jpg">
<img src="gyula.jpg" width="500" height="600">
<img src="gyula.jpg" alt="Gyula himself">
<p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>
<html lang="en">
<p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>


2.1
HTML Headings:
HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading.
Examples:
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>


2.2
<p>	Defines a paragraph
<hr>	Defines a thematic change in the content
<br>	Inserts a single line break
<pre>	Defines pre-formatted text

HTML Paragraphs:
The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.
A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.
Example:
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>


HTML Horizontal Rules:
The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page
Example:
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p>This is some text.</p>
<hr>


The HTML <br> element defines a line break:
Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph
Example:
<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>


The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text:
The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks
Example:
<pre>
 you can type here
 format your text

 and type here.
 other then with paragraph, this acutally formates text in the browser
</pre>
